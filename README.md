# WorldCache / OMR experiments

Private research workspace for improving the quality–time tradeoff of video world models. Initial priority: reproduce Cosmos-Predict2.5-2B Native and WorldCache, then test simple residual calibration. OMR is a conditional second direction.

## Current status

2026-09-29: Cosmos 2.5-2B, tokenizer and Reason1 weights load successfully on the two-card server with no missing/unexpected state keys. Explicit source-completion and config-registration adaptations are documented. Core loading is not a forward/generation test. F1 video generation remains blocked by official Guardrail1 access (HTTP 403). Qwen auxiliary assets pass official metadata hash checks; SigLIP is resuming download. Four-card login is recovered, but its driver is older.

## Reproduce CPU checks

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e . pytest
.venv/bin/python scripts/bootstrap_upstream.py
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

The integration tests extract the pinned upstream functions and execute a synthetic network. They do not establish full-model equivalence or performance. Upstream is downloaded to ignored `vendor/`; weights, videos, environments and credentials are never committed.

## Research records

- `plans/`: original user-supplied plans.
- `research/02_CURRENT_STATE.md`: evidence and unresolved dependencies.
- `research/09_NEXT_ACTIONS.md`: ordered execution scope.
- `memory/handoffs/LATEST.md`: continuation state.
- `manifests/upstream.json`: pinned WorldCache revision and cache-module hash.
- `src/wcomr/`: scalar calibration and shrinkage prototypes, with a version-checked in-memory hook.
- `reports/`: small receipts only; large artifacts stay outside Git.

Every meaningful code/config/result change is committed and pushed to this private repository. No autonomous training, full benchmark, or paid evaluation is part of the initial smoke batch.

F1 execution protocol and evidence limits: `research/04_F1_PROTOCOL.md`. `scripts/supervise_f1.py` is prepared but has not run a real video batch.
