# WorldCache / OMR experiments

Private research workspace for improving the quality–time tradeoff of video world models. Initial priority: reproduce Cosmos-Predict2.5-2B Native and WorldCache, then test simple residual calibration. OMR is a conditional second direction.

## Current status

2026-09-29: F0 preparation; 17 CPU tests pass. No completed GPU generation, speedup measurement, or quality result yet. WorldCache public source omits model directories required by its inference imports; runtime completion is under investigation. Two A6000 GPUs were observed without compute processes; four-card login requires authentication.

## Reproduce CPU checks

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e . pytest
.venv/bin/python scripts/bootstrap_upstream.py
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

The integration tests extract the pinned upstream functions and execute a synthetic network. They do not establish full-model equivalence or performance. Upstream is downloaded to ignored `vendor/`; weights, videos, environments and credentials are never committed.

## Research records

- `plans/`: original user-supplied plans.
- `research/02_CURRENT_STATE.md`: evidence and unresolved dependencies.
- `research/09_NEXT_ACTIONS.md`: ordered execution scope.
- `memory/handoffs/LATEST.md`: continuation state.
- `manifests/upstream.json`: pinned WorldCache revision and cache-module hash.
- `src/wcomr/`: scalar calibration and shrinkage prototypes, with a version-checked in-memory hook.
- `reports/`: small receipts only; large artifacts stay outside Git.

Every meaningful code/config/result change is committed and pushed to this private repository. No autonomous training, full benchmark, or paid evaluation is part of the initial smoke batch.
