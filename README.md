# WorldCache / OMR experiments

Private research workspace for improving the quality–time tradeoff of video world models. Initial priority: reproduce Cosmos-Predict2.5-2B Native and WorldCache, then test simple residual calibration. OMR is a conditional second direction.

## Current status

2026-09-29: 22 CPU tests pass; the complete Linux inference entry point also passes a bounded GPU-visible import. No model-load validation, generated video, speedup measurement, or quality result yet. Missing WorldCache model directories have a separately pinned source-completion candidate. F1 is blocked on auxiliary assets: official access using the existing server HF login returned HTTP 403; model loading remains unvalidated. Four-card login has been recovered using the previous local authentication path; GPUs 2/3 were free. Its driver is older, so the prepared two-card environment remains the current candidate.

## Reproduce CPU checks

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e . pytest
.venv/bin/python scripts/bootstrap_upstream.py
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

The integration tests extract the pinned upstream functions and execute a synthetic network. They do not establish full-model equivalence or performance. Upstream is downloaded to ignored `vendor/`; weights, videos, environments and credentials are never committed.

## Research records

- `plans/`: original user-supplied plans.
- `research/02_CURRENT_STATE.md`: evidence and unresolved dependencies.
- `research/09_NEXT_ACTIONS.md`: ordered execution scope.
- `memory/handoffs/LATEST.md`: continuation state.
- `manifests/upstream.json`: pinned WorldCache revision and cache-module hash.
- `src/wcomr/`: scalar calibration and shrinkage prototypes, with a version-checked in-memory hook.
- `reports/`: small receipts only; large artifacts stay outside Git.

Every meaningful code/config/result change is committed and pushed to this private repository. No autonomous training, full benchmark, or paid evaluation is part of the initial smoke batch.

F1 execution protocol and evidence limits: `research/04_F1_PROTOCOL.md`. `scripts/supervise_f1.py` is prepared but has not run a real video batch.
